    " Abstraction refers to the ability of a software component to hide implementation details from the user and expose only the necessary information.\n",

    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and functions that operate on that data within a single component.\n",

    "The encapsulation of this class would be the implementation of these behaviors and properties as functions and data members within the class, respectively,\n",

    "The abc (Abstract Base Class) module in Python is a module that provides support for abstract base classes.\n",
    "An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to provide a common interface for its subclasses. \n",
    "The idea behind abstract base classes is to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass that wants to conform to the interface defined by the abstract base class.\n",

    "\n",
    " WHY  IT IS USED\n",
    "The abc module is used in Python to enforce an interface for classes in a clear and concise manner. By using the abc module, developers can define an interface that their classes must implement,\n",
    " ensuring that the classes have the desired properties and behaviors. \n",
    "This is especially useful in large systems where many classes interact with each other, as it helps to ensure consistency and compatibility among the classes.\n",

    "Data abstraction can be achieved by creating a logical or conceptual view of data that hides the underlying complexity of the data and only exposes relevant information to the user.\n",
    "This can be accomplished through the use of classes and objects in object-oriented programming, or by implementing data structures such as abstract data types and encapsulation. \n",
    "Additionally, data can be abstracted through the use of databases, where the data is stored in a structured way and can be accessed through a high-level interface, such as SQL.\n",

    "No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class. An abstract class is a class that is declared with the \"abstract\" keyword and it is intended to be used as a base class. \n",
